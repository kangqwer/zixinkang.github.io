I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/). My research interest is bioinformatics, deep learning and AI4Science.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ning](http://www.microbioinformatics.org/people_intro/ningkang.html) of Microbioinformatics group from [Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Technology](https://life.hust.edu.cn/).
